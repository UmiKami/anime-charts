Anime charts page using AniAPI.

- Should display multiple cards with a cover image, title, genre, and possibly brief description of the anime.
- Pagination should be added if there is enough time.

# Diary

- Currently setting up the project.
- Managed to get the API and retrieve necessary information.
- Basic info added.
- Pagination not possible due to the way the API works.
